  "description": "The Pipelex system facilitates AI/ML workflow orchestration, with the `Pipelex Client` serving as the primary user interface for defining and initiating pipelines. This client interacts with a `Templating Engine` to dynamically generate content, such as LLM prompts or configurations, ensuring flexible workflow execution. As pipelines run, the `Pipeline Tracker` diligently monitors and records all execution events and statuses, acting as the central data collection point for observability. This raw execution data is then fed to the `Reporting Manager`, which aggregates and processes it to generate insightful reports on pipeline performance and errors, providing critical analytics for users.",

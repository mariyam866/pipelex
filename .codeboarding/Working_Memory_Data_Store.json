  "description": "The `pipelex` core subsystem is designed around the central concept of `Stuff` objects, which are the fundamental data units. The `StuffFactory` is responsible for the initial creation of these `Stuff` objects from diverse input sources, encapsulating them into a standardized format. Once created, these `Stuff` objects are provided to the `WorkingMemory`. The `WorkingMemory` then assumes the critical role of managing the in-memory state of these `Stuff` objects, handling their storage, retrieval, and overall lifecycle within the pipeline, thereby ensuring data consistency and accessibility for subsequent processing stages. This architecture facilitates a clear separation of concerns, with `StuffFactory` handling data ingestion and `WorkingMemory` managing the in-memory data state.",

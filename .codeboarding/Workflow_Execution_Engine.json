  "description": "The `pipelex` system is designed around a robust pipeline orchestration architecture. External clients interact via the `Client Interface`, which leverages the `Hub` to provision and manage `Pipeline Manager` instances. The `Pipeline Manager` orchestrates the high-level execution flow, delegating the detailed control of pipeline segments to the `Pipe Controller`. The `Pipe Controller` then dispatches to various `Specialized Pipe Controllers` (Sequence, Condition, Parallel, Batch) to implement specific control flow patterns. Throughout this process, `Working Memory` provides the necessary state and data context. The actual processing tasks are performed by `Pipe Operator` components, which are invoked by the `Specialized Pipe Controllers`, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between control flow and operational logic.",

  "description": "The `pipelex` system, at its core, orchestrates intelligent content generation and processing. The `Query Processor` initiates workflows by interpreting incoming requests. These requests are then passed to the `Language Model Interface`, which leverages the `Data & Knowledge Management` component to select and configure appropriate models. The `Language Model Interface` can also direct the `Tool Executor` to perform specialized tasks, integrating external capabilities. Finally, the `Response Formatter` structures the generated outputs for consumption. The `Data & Knowledge Management` component acts as a central repository for model configurations, routing logic, and inference backends, ensuring that the right models are used for the right tasks.",

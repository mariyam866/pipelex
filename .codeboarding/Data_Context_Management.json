It provides a comprehensive API for managing this data, including adding, retrieving, updating, and removing `Stuff` objects, and handling their naming and aliasing. It ensures data consistency and facilitates data retrieval in various formats. This component is fundamental for state management and data passing between pipeline steps in an AI/ML workflow.",

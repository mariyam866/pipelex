## Details

The `pipelex` system is structured around a core `Pipeline` component responsible for defining and orchestrating AI workflows. As pipelines execute, the `PipelineTracker` diligently monitors and collects granular execution data and events, forming the foundation for performance and activity insights. This raw tracking data is then consumed by the `ReportingManager`, which processes and transforms it into actionable reports and visualizations. Users interact with the system primarily through the `PipelexCLI`, which facilitates the request and display of these generated reports, enabling effective monitoring and analysis of pipeline operations.

### pipelex.pipeline.pipeline.Pipeline
Represents the definition of an AI pipeline, outlining its structure and configuration. It serves as a blueprint for execution, defining the sequence of operations and data flow.

### pipelex.pipeline.track.pipeline_tracker.PipelineTracker
The data acquisition layer of the monitoring subsystem. It actively observes, collects, and records raw execution data, events, and metrics emitted by the pipeline during workflow execution. This component is crucial for capturing the granular details of each step.

### pipelex.reporting.reporting_manager.ReportingManager
The processing and presentation layer of the monitoring subsystem. It aggregates, analyzes, and transforms the raw tracking data received from `pipelex.pipeline.track.pipeline_tracker.PipelineTracker` into meaningful reports, summaries, and visualizations (e.g., activity logs, usage metrics, performance dashboards, and visual flowcharts).

  "description": "The Core Pipeline Orchestrator subsystem is responsible for managing and executing AI workflows within the Pipelex system. It encompasses key modules like the Pipelex Application for initialization, the Pipelex Hub for service location, the Pipeline Manager for handling pipeline definitions, the Pipe Router for execution dispatch, and Pipe Controllers for concrete pipe execution logic. Its main purpose is to provide a robust and extensible framework for orchestrating AI pipelines.",

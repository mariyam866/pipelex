  "description": "The `pipelex` core memory and data artifact subsystem is designed around the `WorkingMemory` component, which serves as the central, transient store for all data artifacts, represented by `Stuff` objects. `WorkingMemoryFactory` is responsible for initializing `WorkingMemory` instances. Each `Stuff` object encapsulates `StuffContent`, which holds the raw data and handles type-specific operations, including rendering. `StuffFactory` facilitates the creation of `Stuff` and `StuffContent` from various inputs. For rendering purposes, `Stuff` can create a `StuffArtefact` from its `StuffContent`, providing a specialized, renderable view suitable for templating engines. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated components for data storage, content encapsulation, rendering representation, and object creation.",

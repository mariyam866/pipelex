  "description": "The `pipelex` system orchestrates content generation pipelines, primarily focusing on LLM, image generation, and OCR tasks. At its core, the system leverages a `Content Generator` to execute these pipelines, which in turn relies on various job components and workers for specific tasks. The `LLM Report` component is responsible for summarizing the outcomes of LLM-specific pipeline executions, providing insights into their performance and results. The overall architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing for flexible integration of different content generation technologies and robust reporting capabilities.",

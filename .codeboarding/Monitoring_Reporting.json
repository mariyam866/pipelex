  "description": "The `pipelex` system is structured around a core `Pipeline` component responsible for defining and orchestrating AI workflows. As pipelines execute, the `PipelineTracker` diligently monitors and collects granular execution data and events, forming the foundation for performance and activity insights. This raw tracking data is then consumed by the `ReportingManager`, which processes and transforms it into actionable reports and visualizations. Users interact with the system primarily through the `PipelexCLI`, which facilitates the request and display of these generated reports, enabling effective monitoring and analysis of pipeline operations.",

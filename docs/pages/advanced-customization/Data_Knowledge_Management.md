## Details

The `pipelex` system, at its core, orchestrates intelligent content generation and processing. The `Query Processor` initiates workflows by interpreting incoming requests. These requests are then passed to the `Language Model Interface`, which leverages the `Data & Knowledge Management` component to select and configure appropriate models. The `Language Model Interface` can also direct the `Tool Executor` to perform specialized tasks, integrating external capabilities. Finally, the `Response Formatter` structures the generated outputs for consumption. The `Data & Knowledge Management` component acts as a central repository for model configurations, routing logic, and inference backends, ensuring that the right models are used for the right tasks.

### Data & Knowledge Management [[Expand]](./Data_Knowledge_Management.md)
Manages the configuration and specifications of various models, routing profiles, and inference backends. It is responsible for loading model definitions, building the model deck, and providing access to inference models and their associated backends. This component underpins the system's ability to select and utilize appropriate models for different tasks.

### Response Formatter
Structures and formats the final output from the AI workflow into a user-friendly or system-consumable representation, ensuring clarity and consistency. This would involve processing the reports generated by the LLM jobs.
